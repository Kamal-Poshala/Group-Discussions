This is a discussion on the Project Internship Program Management System (IPMS).

## Project Overview
The project is designed to streamline the internship requests, approval and reporting processes for students who enrolled in the internship programs. This system should automate the workflow, ensure the alignment with computer science outcomes and promotes or enhance the transparency.
## Goals
  * The workflow of the internships should simplified.
  * we should provide clear communications for the stakeholders (Students or Teachers).
  * And everything sould be aligned with the academic outcomes.


## Functioinal Requirements

    * Using SMART Form A1, students should submit their internship details.
    * Here, we should verify task alignments with the outcomes of CS progam.
### 3. Approval Workflows
    * We should automate supervisor and co-ordinator approavals.
    * we should send reminders for the pending actions.

    * Generation of final report for submissions.


## Non Functional Requriments
* 1. Scalability : Simultaneously it should support upto 1000 users.
  2. Security : we should ensure security through encryption and authentication.
  3. Reliability : Without failure, it should do the intended work.
  4. Usability : Everyone should be comfortable to the interface.
 
  
## Milestones and Deliverables
